# Gemini Models

As of 2025-07-15, the Google Gemini ecosystem (including Gemini CLI) is limited
to the following models:

1. Gemini 2.5 Pro - the current state-of-the-art thinking model, capable of
   reasoning over complex problems in code, math, and STEM, as well as analyzing
   large datasets, codebases, and documents using long context.
2. Gemini 2.5 Flash - best model in terms of price-performance, offering
   well-rounded capabilities. 2.5 Flash is best for large scale processing,
   low-latency, high volume tasks that require thinking, and agentic use cases.
3. Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite - optimized for cost efficiency and low latency.

A full comprehensive list of models is available [on Google's Gemini API documentation
website](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models).
