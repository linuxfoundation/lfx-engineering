# AI Reviews

The LFX engineering teams supports several AI review tools and services. We
currently have an agreement with both GitHub Copilot and CodeRabbit AI.

## GitHub Copilot Reviews

All LFX organizations and repositories are eligible for GitHub Copilot Reviews
and should be enabled by default. For problems and issues, please [file a ticket
with the CloudOps team](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/4/create/573).

## CodeRabbit AI Reviews

The CloudOps team has enabled CodeRabbit AI for all LFX organizations and
repositories. For problems and issues, please [file a ticket with the CloudOps
team](https://app.coderabbit.ai/settings/repositories). Administrators can
access the CodeRabbit AI console by navigating to [the
dashboard](https://app.coderabbit.ai/settings/repositories). For authentication,
use the GitHub login option.

Additionally, the CodeRabbit AI VSCode and Cursor extensions are available for
installaion. This is highly recommended for all LFX developers as it provides
a great way for developers to get an early review on their proposed coding
changes. Search for "CodeRabbit AI" in the VSCode and Cursor extensions
marketplace. Once installed, connect the extension to your CodeRabbit AI account
and you're ready to go.
