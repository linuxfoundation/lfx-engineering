# Roles and Responsibilities Framework: Product Owners, Engineers, and IT/Operations

## Product Owners

### Product Owners Primary Responsibilities

- Requirements Gathering: Collect, analyze, and prioritize business requirements from stakeholders
- UX Design & User Interactions: Define user experience flows, wireframes, and interaction patterns
- Success Criteria Definition: Establish measurable KPIs, acceptance criteria, and business objectives
- Product Documentation: Maintain product specifications, user stories, and feature documentation

### Product Owners Additional Responsibilities

- Product Strategy & Roadmap: Define long-term product vision and quarterly/annual roadmaps
- Stakeholder Management: Interface with business stakeholders, customers, and executive leadership
- Competitive Analysis: Monitor market trends and competitor features
- User Research & Feedback: Conduct user interviews, surveys, and analyze usage data
- Feature Prioritization: Make trade-off decisions based on business value and technical constraints
- Go-to-Market Planning: Collaborate on launch strategies and marketing requirements
- Compliance & Legal Requirements: Ensure features meet regulatory and legal standards

### Product Owners Boundaries

- Does not make technical architecture decisions
- Does not directly manage engineering resources or timelines
- Does not configure or deploy infrastructure

### Product Owners Escalation and Decision-Making Authority

- Product Decisions: Product Owners have final authority on feature requirements and business priorities
- Technical Decisions: Engineers have authority on technical implementation and architecture choices
- Operational Decisions: IT/Operations has authority on infrastructure, deployment methods, and operational procedures
- Cross-functional Conflicts: Escalate to management when decisions impact multiple domains

## Engineers/Developers

### Engineers/Developers Primary Responsibilities

- End-to-End Software Development: Design, code, and implement UX, backend, and data components
- Testing: Create and execute unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests
- Software Security: Implement security best practices and address vulnerabilities
- Release Documentation: Provide technical inputs for release notes and deployment guides
- Deployment Configuration Support: Specify runtime requirements and configuration needs for IT

### Engineers/Developers Additional Responsibilities

- Technical Architecture: Design system architecture, APIs, and data models
- Code Quality & Standards: Establish coding standards, conduct code reviews, and maintain technical debt
- Performance Optimization: Ensure applications meet performance and scalability requirements
- Technical Documentation: Create API documentation, technical specs, and architecture diagrams
- Environment Management: Support development, staging, and testing environment needs
- Incident Response Support: Provide technical expertise during outages and debugging
- Technology Evaluation: Research and recommend new tools, frameworks, and technologies
- Cross-functional Collaboration: Work with Product Owners on feasibility and IT on deployment requirements

### Engineers/Developers Boundaries

- Does not define business requirements or product strategy
- Does not manage production infrastructure or CI/CD pipelines
- Does not directly handle customer support or business stakeholder communication

## IT/Operations

### IT/Operations Primary Responsibilities

- CI/CD Management: Configure and maintain build, test, and deployment pipelines
- Infrastructure Provisioning: Manage cloud resources, servers, and networking components
- Service Deployment: Execute application deployments across environments
- Monitoring & Alerting: Implement and maintain system monitoring, logging, and alerting
- Incident Management: Respond to outages, coordinate resolution, and conduct post-mortems
- Service Health Reporting: Track and report on uptime, performance metrics, and SLA compliance

### IT/Operations Additional Responsibilities

- Infrastructure Security: Implement security controls, access management, and compliance frameworks
- Capacity Planning: Monitor resource usage and plan for scaling requirements
- Backup & Disaster Recovery: Maintain data backup systems and disaster recovery procedures
- Environment Management: Provision and maintain development, staging, and production environments
- Cost Optimization: Monitor cloud costs and optimize resource allocation
- Vendor Management: Manage relationships with cloud providers and third-party service vendors
- Documentation & Runbooks: Maintain operational procedures and troubleshooting guides
- Compliance & Auditing: Ensure infrastructure meets security and regulatory requirements

### IT/Operations Boundaries

- Does not make product feature decisions or business requirements
- Does not write application code or business logic
- Does not define user experience or product functionality

## Cross-Role Collaboration Points

### Product Planning Phase

- Product Owners define requirements and success criteria
- Engineers provide technical feasibility and effort estimates
- IT/Operations advise on infrastructure constraints and deployment considerations

### Development Phase

- Product Owners provide clarification and acceptance testing
- Engineers develop features and coordinate deployment requirements with IT
- IT/Operations prepare environments and deployment configurations

### Release Phase

- Product Owners coordinate go-to-market activities and communicate with stakeholders
- Engineers support deployment activities and provide technical guidance
- IT/Operations execute deployments and monitor system health

### Post-Release Phase

- Product Owners gather user feedback and measure success metrics
- Engineers address bugs and performance issues
- IT/Operations monitor system performance and manage operational concerns

## Summary of Escalation and Decision-Making Authority

### Product Decisions

- Product Decisions: Product Owners have final authority on feature requirements and business priorities
- Technical Decisions: Engineers have authority on technical implementation and architecture choices
- Operational Decisions: IT/Operations has authority on infrastructure, deployment methods, and operational procedures
- Cross-functional Conflicts: Escalate to management when decisions impact multiple domains
