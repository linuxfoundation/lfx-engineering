# Cursor AI

The LF Engineering team uses Cursor AI to support the development of software,
IT, Operations, Marketing, BizOps, and other teams.

To get started, you will need to
[install the Cursor AI from the website](https://www.cursor.com).

Once Cursor AI is installed, you should request an invite to the Cursor AI
workspace managed by the LF Engineering team. The best way to do this is to join
the `#lf-ai` Slack channel and ask for the invite link. Most users will sign up
using their LF email address.
