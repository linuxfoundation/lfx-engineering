# Zed

## Overview

Zed is a high-performance code editor with advanced AI integration within the editor itself
and through an agent panel. It is recommended to configure the agent with GitHub Copilot.

## Setup

Download and install Zed from the [official website](https://zed.dev/).

Once installed, open Zed and configure the agent with GitHub Copilot:

1. Open the agent panel if not already open (`Cmd+R` on Mac)
2. Open the agent settings, which can be found by clicking the three dots in the
top right corner of the agent panel, select "Settings".
3. Under 'LLM Providers', select 'GitHub Copilot Chat' and sign in with your GitHub account.
The Linux Foundation has access to Copilot through the enterprise plan.
4. To install any MCP servers, there is a panel in the agent settings where you can add
a custom server or install one through a Zed Extension.

## Usage

Within the agent panel, the AI model can be selected with the bottom right button, which will
read as the currently selected model. Select any of the GitHub Copilot models you just configured.
